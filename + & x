EXPERIMENT 1 
AIM: Program to perform basic arithmetic operations (addition and multiplication) and display the result

CODE: 
//Program1(addition)

#include<iostream>
using namespace std;
int main()
{
	int first_number, second_number, sum;
	cout<<"enter the two integers:";
	cin>> first_number >> second_number;
	sum=first_number+second_number;
	cout<< "Sum is "<< sum;
	return 0;
}


//Program2(multiplication)

#include <iostream>
using namespace std;
int main()
{
	double num1, nnum2, product;
	cout<< "Enter two numbers:";
	cin >> num1 >> num2;
	product = num1*num2;
	cout<< "Product is "<< product;
	return 0;
}
